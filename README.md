# Resources

* GobiAPI from https://portland.source.codeaurora.org/patches/quic/gobi/ (also included in libqmi source tree). Has qmuxd structs and logic, as well as the serial structs (e.g. struct sQMUXHeader), but they seem to be unused in it.
* GobiNet from https://portland.source.codeaurora.org/patches/quic/gobi/Gobi_Linux/ (also included in this repository in the "aux/reference" branch). Has serial structs e.g. struct sQMUX and logic.
* libqmi, uqmi, and oFono
